# Cryptographic Protocol Review and Hardening – CVS Health

## Overview
Performed a detailed assessment and enhancement of cryptographic protocols used in CVS Health’s healthcare applications to ensure data confidentiality and integrity.

## Objectives
- Reviewed implementation of AES, RSA, bcrypt, and other cryptographic algorithms.
- Evaluated SSL/TLS configurations and certificate management for secure communications.
- Identified and mitigated weak or insecure cryptographic practices.
- Collaborated with security and development teams to implement best practices.

## Key Achievements
| Area | Outcome |
|-------|---------|
| Protocols Assessed | AES, RSA, bcrypt, SHA-256 |
| Security Enhancements | Improved SSL/TLS setup, updated crypto libraries, enforced key management policies |
| Collaboration | Worked closely with developers to apply cryptographic best practices |

## Learnings
- Deepened understanding of cryptographic standards and real-world application.
- Gained practical experience auditing and strengthening cryptographic protocols.
- Enhanced collaboration skills with cross-functional teams for secure software design.
